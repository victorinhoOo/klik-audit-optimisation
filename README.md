# Audit and Optimization of the Klik Application

[🇬🇧 English](README.md) | [🇫🇷 Français](README.fr.md)

---

👩🏻‍💻 As part of the semester 4 Saé, we were tasked with auditing and optimizing an application as a team, following an incremental development approach.  
Using an existing application as a starting point, the goal was to audit and optimize it based on quality paradigms (ergonomics, software quality, etc.), focusing on accessibility, environmental impact, and security.

Klik is a social network offering features like forums, blogs, event management, and polls. It allows users to create interactive content, participate in discussions, and vote on various topics.

**This repository presents the optimized version of this application at the end of the semester 4 Saé.**
